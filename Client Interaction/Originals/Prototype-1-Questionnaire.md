## Weight Tracker Prototype 1: Questionnaire
If you haven't done so already, please obtain the latest prototype build at https://github.com/alexpotter1/WeightTracker/releases

### This prototype focuses on User Management and the structure of the main window.

**On a scale from 1 to 5, how easy do you think it was to select and create a user, and why?**

> It was simple to create and select a new user. This was due to a relatively uncluttered interface, allowing easy selection of the relevant elements.

**To what extent would you agree that the 'Create new user' window is effectively placed in the application?**

> I think that the 'Create new user' button (that links to the window) would benefit from being ranged to the left, further differentiating it from the 'Continue' button and giving a more balanced look to the window.

**How well do you think that white space is used in the initial and main application windows?**

> There is a little too much white space at the top and not enough at the base. Maybe following the rule of thirds would be of benefit here.

<div class="page-break"></div>


**In the main window, are there any design elements that you think could be changed or improved?**

> Generally the window is good. Again the elements are all clear and easy to see and select. I think the 'Users' button may need to be put in a different position though, as it looks a little out of place at the moment.

**Finally, are there any changes or improvements that you would like to see in the design/functionality of the initial user window and main window?**

> So far the app is very easy to use. One area of improvement could be on the initial creation of a new user, you go straight through to the Weight Tracker main window rather than then having to select from a drop down menu post creation.

Thanks for giving feedback.

*In addition, the client also gave more feedback verbally:*
> The client said that he could create two or more users with the same name, so I might have to perform data validation to check if the name already exists.
