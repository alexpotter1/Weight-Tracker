###Initial Feasibility Study

Based on the initial problem definition, the feasibility study will try to resolve questions that relate to whether the proposed application is suitable for use, or not.

1.	Is the solution able to be produced in a reasonable time?
I believe this program can be produced in line with OCRâ€™s expectations for coursework completion, as the project is realistic enough to achieve over several months of development.

2.	 Will the solution have legality issues, regarding copyright?
The proposed solution will use copyrighted user interface APIs supplied by Apple, known as Cocoa. However, Apple gives permission to application developers so that they can use the APIs to create a well designed and functional product.

3.	Will the solution run on the intended computer?
The computer runs a recent version of the Macintosh operating system, known as OS X. The version that the target runs is the earliest version of OS X that includes the Swift compiler, so this application should run in theory.
