## Initial Interview Plan
### Information collection methods
In this project I plan to collect information about how the main features that the client wants will be implemented in the designing and building of the application.

I plan to talk to the client, face-to-face, initially through interviews directed by questions that I will ask the client, and later on (during testing) I plan to show the client an interactive prototype of where the application is currently at (in terms of development), and then I can ask them what they think of each section of code and note down any major issues that they have, points of improvement and aspects of the prototype that they like.

The reason for not giving questionnaires during testing is for two main reasons:

* The questionnaires provide quite a rigid structure to testing and asking the client questions about the application, and the actual testing session may not follow the questionnaire direction (due to crashes/errors in features, etc).

* I wouldn't want to give the user too much direction on how to operate the software (by using questionnaires and instructions to use the different features of the prototype) because if they can use the software without direction, then this may suggest that the application is relatively intuitive to use. Conversely, if they need support and direction when using the application as a whole, then this can suggest to me that the application could be better designed from a usability standpoint.

### Interview
I plan to ask the following questions for the initial investigation of the user's requirements to hopefully provoke a detailed discussion about what they want the application to do.

1. What would be the data that you want the application to accept as input and show as output?

2. Are there any specific actions or features that you want the application to do or have?

3. How do you collect this information currently - are there any aspects of this that you want to be duplicated in the application?

4. Are there any preferences for how the information should be displayed?

5. What are the issues with the current method, or any other applications or software packages that you have tried?

From the information that the client gives, I can start to build a definition of the problem as well as put into place requirements that the software has to achieve.
