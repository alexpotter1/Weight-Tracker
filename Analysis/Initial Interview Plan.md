## Initial Interview Plan

I plan to ask the following questions for the initial investigation of the user's requirements to hopefully provoke a detailed discussion about what they want the application to do.

1. You've already said that you want a application to track a user's weight, but are there any specific actions that you would want the application to enable you to do?

2. How do you collect this information currently - are there any aspects of this that you want to be duplicated in the application?

3. Are there any preferences for how the information should be displayed?

4. What are the issues with the current method, or any other applications or software packages that you have tried?

From the information that the client gives, I can start to build a definition of the problem as well as put into place requirements that the software has to achieve.
