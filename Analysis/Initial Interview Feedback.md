## Initial Interview Results

To begin discussions with the client, I used the questions in the [Initial Interview Plan](Initial Interview Plan.md), and here is the client's response:

* You've already said that you want a application to track a user's weight, but are there any specific actions that you would want the application to enable you to do?

> Having tried some other weight applications, the main features that I see from them are features such as a graph to display the user's weight over time, and predictions of your weight after a period of time. If possible, I would want these features to be replicated in this application - another main feature that I would want is being able to input weight in more than one unit; many applications have units for kilograms and pounds but not the stones and pounds unit that we tend to use in this country and since there are, in my experience, no applications that do that, then this feature would be paramount for this application.

> If the application could also backup data to an external cloud provider such as Dropbox (which I use regularly) then that would be an added bonus but I wouldn't say that this is required.

* How do you collect this information currently - are there any aspects of this that you want to be duplicated in the application?

> I have tried, as I say, a few applications on iOS but I don't use them because of the lack of the stones & pounds unit as I discussed before. Currently, I use a paper based method, and I have a table with two rows - the date and the weight and I simply write in my new weight every week. Of course, this can be tedious so if possible I would want that to be digitised either on my phone or my computer.

* Are there any preferences for how the information should be displayed?

> Besides the basics, I am not going to set out a specific design for you to follow just as long as you include all of the features that were asked for. In addition, I would expect the application to be relatively easy to use and it should present the information in a simple manner without needing much mental effort to access the stored information.

* What are the issues with the current method, or any other applications or software packages that you have tried?

> Besides the stones & pounds unit absence in other applications, I also didn't tend to use applications such as "MyFitnessPal" and Apple's built-in Health application on the iPhone because they either required to sign-up for the service or that they are too complicated and have too many features for my needs - they duplicate some things such as counting of calories, for example, which I already do myself.
