####Requirement Specification

Based upon the initial feasibility study and interaction with the client, the proposed requirements of the system are as follows:

1. The system must have a method of inputting weight data over a specified period of time;

2. The system must be able to function with weight in measurement units of pounds, kilograms, as well as stones and pounds;

3. The system will have a means of providing visual feedback to the user via a graphical method.

#####Hardware Requirements
The hardware requirements for this application are based upon the client's computer.

*The client's computer is a 24-inch Late 2007 iMac. System specifications are shown (from apple.com):*

* 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4MB L2 cache and 800MHz FSB

* 4GB 667MHz DDR2 RAM

* 320GB Serial ATA HDD

* 8x Apple SuperDrive CD/DVDÂ±RW drive

* 24-inch display, 1920x1200 pixels, 16M colours

* ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR3 video memory

* FireWire 800 (IEEE1394), USB 2.0

* Gigabit Ethernet & WiFi 802.11n

#####Software Requirements
Since the solution will be built in Apple's Xcode development environment and since it will utilise Swift as the language, the product should work on all recent Mac OS X versions above 10.9 Mavericks (when initial support for Swift was added).

*The target computer's operating system:*
* Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks
