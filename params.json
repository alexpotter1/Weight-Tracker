{"name":"WeightTracker","tagline":"Weight Tracker for Mac ","body":"# WeightTracker\r\n## Latest version: 0.1-wip\r\nI present the **work-in progress** state of Weight Tracker for Mac.\r\n\r\n### What is it?\r\nWeight Tracker is a simple application that is able to track a user's weight over a period of time, leading to an eventual goal. The program can display the progress via a graph.\r\n\r\nThe user can decide to input their weight in either pounds (lbs), kilograms (kg) or stones & pounds (st lb).\r\n\r\n### Cool, where can I download it?\r\nWell...there are no releases at the moment, because it isn't finished yet.\r\n\r\nThis Git project is structured in the format that I need for this to be able to be submitted as a coursework project, so documentation exists alongside application code.\r\n\r\nThe application is written in Swift and is designed to work with Mac OS X Mavericks and later.\r\n\r\n### What about forking this project?\r\nLots of Apple proprietary code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. So is this app.\r\n\r\nFor the Macintosh platform, it is free to develop an application that is distributed outside of the App Store. So, you could download Xcode and improve this app, if you wanted to!\r\n\r\nYou can of course fork this project, as per GitHub's Terms of Service, but be careful to honour the Apache 2.0 License, and any subsequent copyright notices.\r\n\r\nThe Apache License is located in the LICENSE folder at the root of this repository.\r\n\r\nCopyright © Apple 2015 Copyright © Alex Potter 2015\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
