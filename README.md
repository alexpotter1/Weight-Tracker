# WeightTracker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexpotter1/WeightTracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexpotter1/WeightTracker)
## Latest version: 0.5-wip
I present the **work-in progress** state of Weight Tracker for Mac.

### What is it?
Weight Tracker is a simple application that is able to track and predict a user's weight over a period of time, leading to an eventual goal. The program can display the progress via a graph.

The user can decide to input their weight in either pounds (lbs), kilograms (kg) or stones & pounds (st lb).

### Cool, where can I download it?
Well...there are no releases at the moment, because it isn't finished yet.

This Git project is structured in the format that I need for this to be able to be submitted as a coursework project, so documentation exists alongside application code.

The application is written in Swift and is designed to work with Mac OS X Mavericks and later.

### What about forking this project?
Lots of Apple proprietary code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. So is this app.

For the Macintosh platform, it is free to develop an application that is distributed outside of the App Store. So, you could download Xcode and improve this app, if you wanted to!

You can of course fork this project, as per GitHub's Terms of Service, but be careful to honour the Apache 2.0 License, and any subsequent copyright notices.

The Apache License is located in the LICENSE folder at the root of this repository.
