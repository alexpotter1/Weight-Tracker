<p>I present the <strong>work-in progress</strong> state of Weight Tracker for Mac.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h3>

<p>Weight Tracker is a simple application that is able to track a user's weight over a period of time, leading to an eventual goal. The program can display the progress via a graph.</p>

<p>The user can decide to input their weight in either pounds (lbs), kilograms (kg) or stones &amp; pounds (st lb).</p>

<a id="cool-where-can-i-download-it" class="anchor" href="#cool-where-can-i-download-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cool, where can I download it?</h3>

<p>Well...there are no releases at the moment, because it isn't finished yet.</p>

<p>This Git project is structured in the format that I need for this to be able to be submitted as a coursework project, so documentation exists alongside application code.</p>

<p>The application is written in Swift and is designed to work with Mac OS X Mavericks and later.</p>

<p>For the Macintosh platform, it is free to develop an application that is distributed outside of the App Store. So, you could download Xcode and improve this app, if you wanted to!</p>
